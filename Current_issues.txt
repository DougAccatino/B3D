Issue #A001
Heater_generic may not be the best solution for this configuration. If it is set on, and doesnt meet its expected heat output, it will shut down.

A workaround for this may be a macro that would pull current thermistor temp, and add 5c to a generic_heater, wait 30 seconds, then add 5 if its at the input temp +5, and repeat until its at a given temp.

Another workaround is the obvious, implementing my own Klipper module.

Until Klipper has full support for multiple heater_bed sections, the entirety of the projects function may have workarounds.
*I believe i have figured out a fix for this. Testing will be required.
3/30/22 - Testing has revealed a most probable fix, utilizing the [verify_heaters] section to alter heater_generic parameters.
